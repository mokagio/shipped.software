      <description>I recently submitted the first update in 3.5 years of fineants for review to the App Store.
The app helps visualise delayed gratification to reach your saving goals. A big part of saving money is not spending them. Users can log the things they don&amp;rsquo;t buy on fineants, keeping track of how much money they have been saving.
I decided to start working on fineants again after such a long time because I noticed a small but steady stream of users and In-App Purchase upgrades.</description>
